Observability is the ability to understand a systemâ€™s internal state by analyzing its outputs like logs, metrics, and traces. It helps identify why problems occur, not just that they exist. Unlike monitoring, which focuses on known issues with predefined alerts, observability enables deeper, proactive troubleshooting of complex systems.
