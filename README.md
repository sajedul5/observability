# Observability
Observability is the ability to understand a system’s internal state by analyzing its outputs like logs, metrics, and traces. It helps identify why problems occur, not just that they exist. Unlike monitoring, which focuses on known issues with predefined alerts, observability enables deeper, proactive troubleshooting of complex systems.


#  What

| Concept           | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monitoring**    | Monitoring tracks system health and performance using predefined metrics and alerts.              |
| **Observability** | Observability helps you understand *why* a system is misbehaving using metrics, logs, and traces. |

# Why

| Purpose        | Monitoring                             | Observability                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**       | Detect known issues and trigger alerts | Diagnose unknown issues and root causes        |
| **Helps with** | Uptime, SLAs, threshold breaches       | Debugging, latency analysis, incident response |


# How (Approach + Tools)

✅ Monitoring
Collect key metrics (CPU, memory, requests).

Set thresholds and alerts.

Tools: Prometheus, Zabbix, CloudWatch, Datadog.

✅ Observability
Instrument code to emit rich telemetry.

Use collectors like OpenTelemetry.

Correlate Metrics → Logs → Traces.

Tools: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger, Grafana.


# 3 Pillars of Observability

| Pillar         | Purpose                                      | Example                                 | Tools                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **1. Metrics** | Quantitative data over time (fast, alerting) | Request rate, CPU usage, error %        | Prometheus, CloudWatch |
| **2. Logs**    | Detailed, timestamped event data             | “Payment gateway timeout”               | Loki, ELK, Fluent Bit  |
| **3. Traces**  | Request journey across services              | Track checkout latency through services | Jaeger, Tempo, Zipkin  |

# Real-World Production Example

🎯 Scenario: Checkout Failure on an E-commerce Platform (Kubernetes-based)
Customers report checkout is slow or failing.

🔍 Monitoring:
Prometheus shows CPU/memory are fine.

No alert is triggered.

Monitoring doesn't detect any clear issue.

🔎 Observability:
Metrics: checkout_latency_seconds is high.

Logs: payment-service shows TimeoutError with external gateway.

Traces: Jaeger shows delay at checkout → payment span.

🔧 Root Cause: External payment API is slow — confirmed in trace and logs.

➡️ Without observability, this would take hours/days.
➡️ With observability, issue is identified and fixed quickly.

| Feature        | Monitoring         | Observability                        |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Detect issues  | ✔️                 | ✔️                                   |
| Diagnose cause | ❌ (limited)        | ✔️ (deep, exploratory)               |
| Data Types     | Metrics only       | Metrics + Logs + Traces              |
| Tools          | Prometheus, Zabbix | OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki |
| Use Case       | “Is it working?”   | “Why is it slow/failing?”            |
